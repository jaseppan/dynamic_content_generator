# Dynamic Content Generator

Version: 0.1.0

If you're using Git for version control (which you likely are if you're on GitHub), you can use Git tags to mark versions:

bash
Copy code
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release"
git push origin v0.1.0
This will create a tagged version in your Git repository. Users can then easily check out specific versions using these tags.

In the setup.py (if distributing with setuptools):

If you plan on distributing your module via PyPI and you have a setup.py, you'll include the version number there as well:

python
Copy code
setup(
    name='generated_content',
    version='0.1.0',
    # ... other arguments ...
)
It's important to keep the version number consistent across these places. If you make updates to your module, increment the version number according to Semantic Versioning principles:

Major version for incompatible changes.
Minor version for backward-compatible new features.
Patch version for backward-compatible bug fixes.






A Python module designed to generate dynamic content based on specific patterns using the Faker library. This tool can be seamlessly integrated into larger applications where randomized test data is required.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaseppan/dynamic-content-generator.git
```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd dynamic_content_generator
```
3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Import the module and use the `generated_content` function:

```python
from generated_content.generator import generated_content

output = generated_content("%name lives in %city and loves %word.")
print(output)

This might produce an output like:
Jane Doe lives in Springfield and loves programming.
```

## Testing

To run the tests:
```bash
python3 -m unittest tests/test.py
```

## Integration

To use this as part of a larger application, simply import the module and integrate the generated_content function as needed. Make sure to adjust the Python path or package structure to accommodate the location of this module in your larger application.



## Adding More Data Generation Methods
To extend the set of data generation methods, update the generated_content/methods.py file by adding the desired key-method pairs to the faker_methods_dict.
